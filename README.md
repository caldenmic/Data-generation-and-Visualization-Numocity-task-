Generate fake data on the charging summary given in the csv_summary_30.csv file and visualize the results

This project has two folders one which summarises data following a heirarchial file structure of year->month->day and the other folder which just summarises the files in the root directory.

- To summarise the generated data run the csv_summariser.py
